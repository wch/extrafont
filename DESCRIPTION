Description: Tools to using fonts other than the standard PostScript fonts.
    This package makes it easy to use system TrueType fonts and with
    PDF or PostScript output files. It can also be used with fonts packaged
    specifically to be used with it, such as the fontcm package, which
    has Computer Modern PostScript fonts with math symbols.
