* One of the Linux font search paths has been changed to /usr/share/fonts, so
  that it works with Arch and Gentoo.

* extrafont now searches in the user font directory, ~/.fonts on Linux
  and BSD, and ~/Library/Fonts on Mac OS X.

extrafont 0.11
----------------------------------------------------------------

* extrafont now ignores case when searching for font files.

* All metrics are imported from Truetype fonts. Previously, only the
  metrics for Latin1 were imported. This fixes problems where hyphens
  and minus signs were not allocated enough space. (Thanks to Brian
  Kriegler and Erik Iverson for their investigation of the problem.
  Fixes #11)

* The AFM (font metrics) files are now gzipped.

extrafont 0.10
----------------------------------------------------------------

* A default Truetype font search path for FreeBSD has been added.
  (Thanks to Rainer Hurling)

* extrafont now also makes it easy to use fonts for bitmap output on
  Windows. Use `loadfonts("win")` to register the fonts in Windows.

* loadfonts() now has a `quiet` option to suppress output.
