extrafont 0.10
----------------------------------------------------------------

* A default Truetype font search path for FreeBSD has been added.
  (Thanks to Rainer Hurling)

* extrafont now also makes it easy to use fonts for bitmap output on
  Windows. Use `loadfonts("win")` to register the fonts in Windows.

* loadfonts() now has a `quiet` option to suppress output.
