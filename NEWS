extrafont 0.16
----------------------------------------------------------------

* When importing fonts, don't create duplicate entries. (Fixes #31. Thanks to
  Dylan Schwilk)

extrafont 0.15
----------------------------------------------------------------

* Fix handling of filenames with spaces in R <= 2.15.2.

extrafont 0.14
----------------------------------------------------------------

* Workaround for a bug in ghostscript: if the fontmap path includes the string
  "Resources", it gives an error. Now, in this situation, a temporary symlink
  is made to the fontmap path. (Thanks to Kohske Takahashi)

* `loadfonts(quiet=TRUE)` no longer displays warning messages.

extrafont 0.13
----------------------------------------------------------------

* embed_fonts() now can handle filenames with spaces.

* A new function choose_fonts() has been added, which allows the user to
  specify a set of fonts, and it will return the first one available on the
  current system. (Thanks to Jeffrey Arnold)

* Imported fonts are now automatically registered when extrafont is attached.

extrafont 0.12
----------------------------------------------------------------

* One of the Linux font search paths has been changed to /usr/share/fonts, so
  that it works with Arch and Gentoo.

* extrafont now searches in the user font directory, ~/.fonts on Linux
  and BSD, and ~/Library/Fonts on Mac OS X.

extrafont 0.11
----------------------------------------------------------------

* extrafont now ignores case when searching for font files.

* All metrics are imported from Truetype fonts. Previously, only the
  metrics for Latin1 were imported. This fixes problems where hyphens
  and minus signs were not allocated enough space. (Thanks to Brian
  Kriegler and Erik Iverson for their investigation of the problem.
  Fixes #11)

* The AFM (font metrics) files are now gzipped.

extrafont 0.10
----------------------------------------------------------------

* A default Truetype font search path for FreeBSD has been added.
  (Thanks to Rainer Hurling)

* extrafont now also makes it easy to use fonts for bitmap output on
  Windows. Use `loadfonts("win")` to register the fonts in Windows.

* loadfonts() now has a `quiet` option to suppress output.
