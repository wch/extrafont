* extrafont now ignores case when searching for font files.

* All glyphs are imported from Truetype fonts. This fixes problems where
  hyphens and minus signs were not allocated enough space. (Thanks to
  Brian Kriegler and Erik Iverson for their investigation of the problem.
  Fixes #11)

* The AFM (font metrics) files are now gzipped.

extrafont 0.10
----------------------------------------------------------------

* A default Truetype font search path for FreeBSD has been added.
  (Thanks to Rainer Hurling)

* extrafont now also makes it easy to use fonts for bitmap output on
  Windows. Use `loadfonts("win")` to register the fonts in Windows.

* loadfonts() now has a `quiet` option to suppress output.
